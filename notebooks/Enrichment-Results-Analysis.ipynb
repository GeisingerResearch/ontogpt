      "MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase. In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]\n",
      "PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]\n",
      "SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]\n",
      "MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)- activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals. This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]\n",
      "LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID: 8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]\n",
      "EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]\n",
      "SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain, and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]\n",
      "PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]\n",
      "CARMIL1: Involved in several processes, including actin filament network formation; plasma membrane bounded cell projection organization; and positive regulation of cellular component organization. Located in several cellular components, including lamellipodium; macropinosome; and nuclear speck. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]\n",
      "AHSG: The protein encoded by this gene is a negatively-charged serum glycoprotein that is synthesized by hepatocytes. The encoded protein consists of two polypeptide chains, which are both cleaved from a proprotein encoded from a single mRNA. It is involved in several processes, including endocytosis, brain development, and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]\n",
      "RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins, which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein, which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]\n",
      "LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]\n",
      "UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]\n",
      "DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble, a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]\n",
      "DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family. It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency 40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]\n",
      "CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin, anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]\n",

They collectively encode proteins that are essential for peroxisome biogenesis, including the import of proteins and lipids into the peroxisomal matrix and membrane. The enrichment of ATP binding and hydrolysis activity, protein C-terminus binding activity, and peroxisome targeting sequence binding activity suggest that these processes involve active transport and molecular recognition. Dysfunction of these genes can result in peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, which are characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations affecting different organ systems.  \n",

Disruptions in these mechanisms can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, sensory ataxia, and spinocerebellar ataxia. The impairment of mitochondrial replication, lysosomal degradation, and protein transport mechanisms play important roles in these diseases. One possible underlying biological mechanism is that dysfunctional transport mechanisms lead to accumulation and aggregation of harmful molecules, resulting in neurodegeneration.  \n",
